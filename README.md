# Agricultural-Predictions-Using-Satellite-Imagery-and-NDVI


SCOPE:

-> Our model aims at making agricultural predictions for a specific region in the Indian Subcontinent, by using historical data, thus enabling better agricultural yield.
-> This method uses the data of twelve previous years, taking a monthly average thus countering the seasonality that occurs every ten years. 
-> This model gives predictions using a metric called the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). 
-> NDVI is the most widely used vegetation index for retrieval of vegetation canopy biophysical properties.
-> NDVI is adopted to analyze remote sensing measurements and assess whether the target being observed contains live green (photosynthesizing) vegetation or not.


RESULTS AND FUTURE SCOPE:

-> Through this project, it is demonstrated that the NDVI values for a particular location can be predicted using a learning model.
-> Given the crops that can be grown on a given set of NDVI values, accurate predictions can be made as to which crop can be cultivated at a given location , thus enabling the farmer to increase his yield.
->This would be beneficial to the farmers of our state Karnataka since very few implementations have been made here.
->In Future, we can create an application that will extract the location and give accurate predictions using the historical data for the location.
->Provide Real-time analytics which help the agricultural experts to make better predictions which in turn  helps the farmers.
